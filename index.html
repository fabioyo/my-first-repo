        <h2>Comparing Fred Wilson's Mining the Museum and Joseph Beuys' Auschwitz Demonstration</h2>

      </div>
      
    
      <p>
        Fred Wilson's Mining the Museum (1992), and Joseph Beuys' Auschwitz Demonstration (1956-1964) are a prime example in the comparison of different but similar strains of conceptualism. Conceived in different countries and periods, the two works however, share an aesthetic of the mnemonic. Although Wilson’s piece was made almost thirty years later than Beuys', the reason both works function similarly is because Wilson, just like Beuys, responds to an aesthetic of the disavowal of history. In Beuys case, he attends to the German’s repression of memory of Nazi Germany, while Wilson attends to the American repression of slavery as being foundational to the U.S.A. we know now, and is still a part of larger institutions. Mining the Museum and Auschwitz Demonstration, are also both presented similarly, the works are featured in a glass case similar to a traditional museum display, with a collection of seemingly authentic historical artifacts. In both it is difficult to locate exactly what is or isn't the artwork. However, in Wilson’s work, the power resides in the contrast and categorization of the artifacts, the slave chains against the luxurious metal jugs and cups, all grouped together under the category “Metalwork 1793-1880”. In Beuys’ work on the other hand, a singular interpretation is more difficult to locate, leading viewers to have different ideas of why all these items are put together. It is quite clear the objects are from WWII Germany and from Auschwitz, but they are all like fragments of memory, never quite coming together to form a cohesive memory. This tension between the necessity of remembering and adequately representing becomes central to Beuys’ work, and can also be seen in Mining the Museum which raises a lot of questions about the role of museums play in collective memory. It pushes the viewers to understand how museums and other institutions are part of the process of forgetting, whether it is about slavery or the Holocaust. In this vein, both works have a very conceptual approach, in the way they question and deconstruct how institutions, such as museums, and collective processes such as memory, function (while showing that memory does not solely function on the individual level).
